# Exercise 2

+ 

**Numerical experiments:**

+ How does the use of a one-level Schwarz preconditioner improve the convergence of the Krylov method?
+ Vary the width of the overlap.
+ How does a variation of prolongation operator influence the convergence:
  + standard additive Schwarz
  + restricted additive Schwarz
  + scaled additive Schwarz
